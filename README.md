# Progressive-Budget

## Description

  Welcome to the new Online/Offline Budget Tracker! This budget app makes it simple. A user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they will populate the total when brought back online. This tracker is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) using IndexDB. We hope you enjoy the app for your daily needs!
